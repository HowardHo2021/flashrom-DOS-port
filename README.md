flashrom for DOS README
-----------------------

_IMPORTANT UPDATE: This project is no longer being actively maintained. This is because I may no longer have time to merge the latest updates to the official flashrom codebase and/or release builds of this flashrom port for DOS on a regular basis._

**If anyone would like to keep updating this repository, please send me an email and we can discuss further. Thanks!**

NOTE: This repo is forked from the official flashrom repo located at https://review.coreboot.org/plugins/gitiles/flashrom/. I have made several modifications to the code in order to be able to cross-compile flashrom for the DOS platform via DJGPP GCC cross-compiler on Linux.

*Please read "README_DOS" for steps on how to compile flashrom for DOS.*
