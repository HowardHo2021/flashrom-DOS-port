# This file is for cross compiling flashrom for DOS with DJGPP.
#
# Make sure the program names match your toolchain
#
# Make sure pkg-config can find your self compiles libpci
# or add the path of your libpci.pc as 'pkg_config_libdir'
# under [properies] below.
#
# If cross-compiling, you may need to set sys_root in the [properties]
# section because meson otherwise assumes the same sysroot as the
# system on which you're building and will get the wrong include files
# (from /usr/include/x86_64 for example) among other possible issues.
