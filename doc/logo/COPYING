The flashrom logo and icons in this directory were originally designed by Stefan Tauner in 2015.
The lettering is based on the "Free Mono" font of the GNU FreeFont family.
The SOIC chip seen in the lettering is based on the SOIC08 narrow STL CAD file from
https://grabcad.com/library/soic-package-narrow-8-10-14-and-16-pins-1
It was rendered by Blender with the Freestyle SVG plugin from
